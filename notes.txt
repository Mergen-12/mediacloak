Creating a mediaclaok software. The software is used for anonymousing a person within a video file using faceswap and deepfake generated facial using stylegan2 project. It also consist of adding an automated subtitle for ease of reading the persons word. As of now the development process is in progress and subtitle module as well as facial detection works fine. The only issue remains is the stylegan2 implementation as the project is very wide and complex in it's nature.
